"A good attempt at something impossible".

Those words mean a lot. As far as I know, no-one has ever beaten it, but more on that later.

I first began this project as "NoBB" (No BaconBot) in 2009 as my first real Lua project, just after I started hosting a Deathmatch server. Before this, my only experience with Lua was in editing Life Support devices for SpaceBuild in 2008.

NoBB and early versions of HAC were simply blacklists of commands, which reported to the server via a concommand. This quickly became useless as more and more cheats were being written.

HeX's AntiCheat began to take shape in early 2010. At first I just added filename keyword checking no NoBB, and later a hook blacklist, global function blacklist, and always expanding the ever increasing concommand blacklist. Eventually this got too big and was crashing GMod when it loaded (I found out GMod has a file limit of 255KB per .lua file), so I started work on a whitelist-based system instead of blacklisting everything possible...

Around March 2011 I wrote a lua file reader to get a private cheat from a player who I was chatting to at the time. This worked perfectly so I integrated this (StreamHKS) into HAC, to check every player who joins. This has worked very well ever since, and has collected a huge amount of private hacks.

HAC has got better and better over time, and as of this post is the best GMod AntiCheat as far as I know. This was all before GMod 13, version HAC106, which I released along with all previous versions on my SVN.

I've also helped a few server admins with AntiCheat systems over the years, especially during the Sethhack days. The biggest being Twoscore and Mindblast. Almost all other servers that use a Lua AntiCheat have stolen code and/or detection methods from HAC.

=== Everything below is from the private GMod 13 version ===

After the GMod 13 switchover, everything was broken as Garry doesn't understand the words "backwards compatibility". I was left with a broken server and a crappy "new" game. I almost quit GMod hosting then, but me and a friend spent about 4 weeks getting it all working again.

I also rewrote a lot of it to make it more efficient during this time. The file reader was the most difficult as Garry changed all the file functions and removed DataStream without replacing its functionality, because he hates everyone.

I finally wrote a replacement for DataStream, NetBurst (sh_HACBurst), which allows unlimited length strings to be sent both ways over net, Garry's new system, using a buffer so as not to overflow the channel, and got the file reader working again (no arbitrary Garry'd 64KB size limit). Although over the years HAC has been running, I've hardly ever changed the serverside code until 2013 (there are still bits of NoBB code in there from 2009...)

Recently, I've been rewriting the whole serverside to make it much easier to add new checks in; a lot of things are now in their own table/namespace. HAC.Speed.Check etc. But it still relies on the 5 year old HAC.DoBan function. The most recent improvement is a system to send checks dynamically, BurstCode I've called it as it uses NetBurst.

It sends one, and then waits for the response before sending another. If any checks fail (hacks were detected), or it times out, it doesn't send more. This means if people are trying to intercept the checks & steal the code, they only get one before being banned.

Some interesting things HAC can do that no other AntiCheat in GMod can, as far as I know:

Console key logger, all keys pressed are logged.
Detection of ANY unknown cvars/concommands, even if not added through Lua.
100% serverside speedhack/angle/anti-aim/sv_cheats/sv_allowcslua detection.
Speedhackers end up in a bin!
Several methods to attempt thwart skiddie file stealers (see sv_FixEnum/sv_BurstCode).
Two different methods of screenshot logging
Checking of bound keys.
Re-binding of keys.
Very large amounts of self-checking to prevent bypasses.
Steam group checking.
Advanced keyword checking of client's Lua files.
Detection of overrides to GMod's default files.
Protection against serverside backdoors/takeover/RCON stealing.
Total blockage of SendFile/RequestFile. Bans anyone uploading/download non-sprays.
Name validation, refuses connection for skiddie/troll names, newlines, invisible spaces, certain UTF chars etc (see sv_PWAuth/sv_UTF)
Total RCON protection. Whitelisted to in-game admin's IP and SteamID.
HIIIIGHWAY TO HELL!
=== Usefulness of HAC vs. C++ cheats ===

HAC works against 100% of all Lua cheats and modules (for real!), but it has real trouble detecting pure C++ cheats. Only by the traces they leave in the engine (CVars etc), and serverside detections (like SMAC) can these be detected.

So now I'm at a point where I have a perfect Lua AntiCheat, but less and less people are using Lua to cheat. There will always be copy+pasted Lua cheats in GMod, it is after all a Lua-based game, but C++ cheats are becoming more of a problem.

Part of the reason I'm releasing all this is

Because engine-based C++ cheats like in CSS are more common for GMod now, it's only a matter of time before increasing numbers of cheaters use them. All it takes is a C++-based Sethhack-like cheat, and it'll be 2012 all over again.
Due to Garry's server browser, my server has been empty more times than it's had players. See http://unitedhosts.org/bar/end for more information.
It's going to cost another Â£480 to renew a server that no-one plays on.
Even when the server was running, people would rather play on cheater-infested DarkRP hosted by 12yo kids who pay to be admin.
GMod isn't the fun sandbox game it used to be back in 2007.
This CoderHire crap is ruining GMod. It used to be about free & open user-made content, now it's about selling the latest shitty addons for DarkRP.
However I will *not\* be leaving quietly. I've spent far too long trying to protect GMod, to keep a fair and clean game for everyone, and look where I am now. Closing down my server due to hacks and a total lack of players.

Therefore I'm releasing an absolutely MASSIVE collection of hacks that have been logged over the years from over 500 cheaters.

These many thousands of folders contain a very large amount of private code (or copy+pasted rubbish) and will no doubt piss off a lot of people. Rough guide as to what is included:

All the HAC ban & report logs (tons of goodies in here)
Lots of private GMod module DLLs. (some with source)
A few C++ hack sources, including an lua injector and file stealers.
Screenshots sent to me from cheaters bragging about their code.
My own notes & ideas file, containing interesting notes/detection ideas/future plans.
A whole load of R&D, random code snippets, test scripts, raw resources such as sound files etc.
=== HAC Bypass methods ===

Pure Lua = No chance. Pure C = Will avoid most of the checks, but may set off usercmd/angle detections. Lua/C = May still set off the above, but this is where the real danger lies. If you know what you're doing, you may be able to be stealthy and avoid 99% of the checks.

=== How to avoid the loss of your marbles ===

Don't even bother detouring anything. Or if you do, do it from C. Beware of bc_XDCheck/bc_FuncThis.
Do not load before HAC. garbage and _R will get you.
Do not load after HAC. You'll get the detoured functions and end up bursting your bagpipes.
A direct attack on HAC or its reporting system, excluding blocking it from loading, may work, but watch out for the hundreds of self-checks.
Screenshots will still get you. Try returning false data.
Don't ever store any hack-related files in the first garrysmod/ folder or above. Yes Lua can read here.
Don't use key binds.
=== HAC's files & modules ===

HAC uses many C++ binary modules on the serverside. These are critical to the functionality of many of the checks and it won't start without them.

The modules were built with Visual Studio 2010 on an XP 32bit platform, and designed to run on Win2003 x86. They probably function fine under an NT6-based OS (win7 etc), but I've not tried. The source & project files are there if you want to compile them for your OS/platform.

=== The end ===

I that hope someone finds all this information useful.

A lot of it certainly isn't public, and the people who do know about what you'll soon read keep it to themselves for obvious reasons. You should now download HAC's source code and begin. I'd start with sv_HAC & en_HAC, then the plugins/DLLs. A find-in-files feature is essential here.

Fuck off you absolute asshole.

ZeroTheFallen (STEAM_0:1:38717786) -- For being a cheating minge, writing backdoor'd addons, profiting from the cheating problem, stealing and leaking HAC's clientside files on Hackforums, and using hacks on my server then claiming that he didn't.

And above all, to Garry -- For constantly breaking things, changing stuff without telling people, not documenting all changes in his "updates", not listening to improvements/bug fixes/complaints or even fucking common sense, having zero care for anyone in the anti-cheating community, and for writing the best sandbox game of all time.

Anyone who I've forgotten, you're probably in the booty archive.

See hac_nosend.lua for the worst of the worst (permaban these people from any server that you own), and sv_SkidList for everyone else.

If you run a server and would like to prevent all these assholes from joining, check out my SkidCheck addon here on GitHub.

And so this ends GMod hosting for me. I'll probably still be playing this game, as there's amusement to be found in the thousands of badly-run RP servers. But it'll never be the same as running my server. I still feel mixed about shutting down, having been with this game & community for so long.

Goodbye, and Garry, if you ever read this, listen to the community for a change instead of "my game my responsibility" in regards to the cheating problem that still exists and that you're currently doing nothing about. I'd start by talking to Willox and me.

=== HAC setup instructions ===

Must have write access to C:/hac_totalbans.txt
"HeX's AntiCheat" goes in addons/, the modules go in lua/bin.
Open sv_HAC.lua and edit HAC.Conf to match your environment. Add your own Steam API key and set the file paths.
Don't bother if the gamemode isn't Sandbox. You'll have to rewrite it all yourself if it isn't.
Do not use ULX, or remove its stupid metatable on _G if you do.
READ ALL THE CODE before you even attempt to start it up. Understand how it works.
Remove the noob blocker
Remove the contents of sh_W_HKS, BUT KEEP AT LEAST ONE LINE.
Remove the contents of sh_W_GSafe.lua, this needs to be re-generated.
Remove only the volatile tables in cl_W_HAC, these also need to be re-generated.
Start the server, it will patch a few files and restart the map. You may need to exit the SRCDS process for it to work properly due to the last GMod update's latest fuckup breaking timers on map change.
Fix any serverside errors.
Changing the line count or even shuffling functions around in en_hac will result in a ban. Make sure to update sv_LPT/sv_HAC if you do this.
Do hac_silent 1 and join, wait for the few thousand ban reports. This will take some time. You may have to edit out the removing of globals from en_hac if the game crashes on spawn/everything is nil.
Whitelist all the reports:
ff_* files go in sh_W_HKS
_G* files go in sh_W_GSafe
Most of the others go in cl_W_HAC, work it out.
Restart the server and rejoin. This time edit the RCount/GCount/GCICount/GCBCount in sv_HAC.
Mac users have different fonts. Make sure to test on Mac OS - OR IT WILL BAN ALL MAC USERS!
=== Critical notes & daily maintenance ===

You'll have to keep up to date with the following:

Review and empty the SCFolder every 45MB (~600 screenshots or so).
A lot of players will create an H_* folder in /data. Add any ff_* files to a folder called "data/ff" and run "ff" on SRCDS, then add the data from "data/hks.txt" to sh_W_HKS, delete ff and hks.txt and restart the server.
cc_*/cv_* files go in sv_CVList.
If someone gets banned, their H_* folder will have an IS_BANNED.txt file. See their ban_* file for what caused it. Also add their ff_* files etc as usual.
Add any sk_* file entries to sv_SkidList.
If you notice new cheats by the kwc_* file, add their filename keywords to sv_ECheck to trigger a detection. Careful of "wooden_shack" etc having "hack" in the name. See sv_ECheck.
You can contact me on Steam for any advice/questions about HAC or how any of it works if you want, but I *ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT* help kids and/or people who can't code set it up.
